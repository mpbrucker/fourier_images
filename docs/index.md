title: The Discrete Cosine Transform
---

# JPEG Compression

In this project we implemented JPEG compression. Our approach to this project was first learning about two-dimensional discrete fourier transforms. We looked at what a two-dimensional fourier transform can look like and then how different type of filters applied to the transforms could then transform the images. Then we learned about the discrete cosine transform, which is similar to the discrete fourier transform, but has properties that make it more useful for image compression. Explore the rest of the tabs to learn what we learned!
